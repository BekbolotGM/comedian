Create a new bot user.

### **Step 7**: Install Comedian to your workspace
Go to "OAuth & Permissions"
Press "Install App" button. Authorize bot

### **Step 8**: Configure permissions
In "OAuth & Permissions" tab, scroll down to Scopes section and add additional permission scopes for Comedian:
```
Access information about your workspace
Add slash commands and add actions to messages (and view related content)
Access the workspace's emoji
Send messages as user
Send messages as TestComedian
```

Press "Save Changes" and Reinstall App

### **Step 9**: Finish configuring environmental variables
- Copy Bot User OAuth Access Token (begins with "xoxb") and assign it as COMEDIAN_SLACK_TOKEN env variable

- Create a separate channel for reporting and copy its ID, assign it to COMEDIAN_REPORT_CHANNEL

Run the following commands to update your env variables: 
```
set -a
. .env
set +a
```

### **Step 10**: Start Comedian
Run: go run main.go

If your configuration is correct, you will receive a message from Comedian with simple "Hello Manager" text. Then proceed to check if slash commands are working. Try to get a list of comedian admins (/list admin) and see it it works. 

In case something does not work correctly double check the configuration and make sure you did not miss any installation steps.


## Deploy on [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/)
If you are willing to use Comedian for your organization, we recommend you to proceed with Digital Ocean droplet. Here is the basic instructions how to deploy Comedian to DO:

### **Step 1**: Purchase Droplet
1. Login to Digital Ocean
2. Add new project 
3. Add a droplet, choose Ubuntu 18.10 as your distributive
4. Select $5 per month plan
5. Do not add ssh key (if you are new to configuration)
6. Choose a name for your droplet
7. Press "create" button

After some time you will get an email with all info needed to login to your droplet

### **Step 2**: Configure the server
Login to your newly created server using SSH. You should have recieved email from Digital Ocean with IP address, login and a password. 

Open your terminal, type `ssh login@ipaddress` and then insert password. If this is your first time using this server, DO will ask you to reset the password. 

Next step is to [install docker-compose](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-docker-compose-on-ubuntu-18-04) and [docker](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-18-04)

### **Step 3.0**: Push your code to Dockerhub 

1. run `sudo make` to build local up-to-date Comedian image
2. Create dockerhub repository for Comedian
3. run `docker tag comedian <yourDockerHubRepo/here>` to create new tag and 
4. run `docker push <yourDockerHubRepo/here>` to push it to your repository


### **Step 3.1**: Prepare docker-compose file 

run `nano docker-compose.yml` to create your docker-compose file. Use docker-compose.yml file from the repository to set up it properly. You can use env variables inside or just type parameters right there for better readability. 

Save changes and create new folder `docker`. Execute the following command to give it proper access `chmod 755 docker`. Now you have your volumes configured so that your DB never gets dropped if something happens with the container. 

Make sure to use updated Comedian images from your repository on DockerHub, where you will push your code

Save the changes and proceed to the next step. If you use .env file, make sure you updated your env variables before Step 4.

If you care about security, you may use https://github.com/JrCs/docker-letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion to configure Let's Encrypt certificates. 


### **Step 4**: Install chatbot to your workspace
Follow Steps 4-9 of the local installation guidelines before you proceed! 
ATTENTION
Request URL for all slash commands will be the following: ```http://yourIPaddress:8080/commands``` )

### **Step 5**: Use docker-compose 

Once your docker-compose.yml file is ready and you installed Comedian App in your workspace, run `docker-compose up` or `docker-compose up -d` to start Comedian on the background.

Follow Step 10 of the local installation guide to check if Comedian was installed successfully. 

## Usage

First, you need to start remote standups meetings in Slack. 

Create a channel for it. Then add Comedian in the channel and ask your team to write messages with answers to the following questions tagging bot in the message:

1. What I did yesterday?
2. What I'm going to do today?
3. What problems I've faced?

Setup standups deadline when users should be ready to submit standups
Assign users to submit standups 

Enjoy automated remote standups meetings each morning!
