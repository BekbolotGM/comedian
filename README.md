## Local Development
Comedian works with Slack apps, if you already have a slack app configured for comedian, proceed with step, othervise, follow the steps below: 

### **Step 1**: Create a public HTTPS URL for Comedian
Install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/product) and create a public HTTPS URL for Comedian on your development machine by running `ngrok http 8080`

### **Step 2**: Create Slack chatbot 
Create "app" in slack workspace: https://api.slack.com/apps
In the drop-down list at the top select the created "app"
Obtain App Credentals in basic info section and export them

```
export SLACK_CLIENT_ID=383672116036.563661723157
export SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET=6b0826c3b77fd072dc1ec1fc5c582743
export SLACK_VERIFICATION_TOKEN=Oiwpp2x5Jup1jdQxdtnYTOWT
```

### **Step 3**: Add bot user 
From the left sidebar select "Bot users". Create a bot user with any name you like. Turn on "Always show my bot online" feature. 

### **Step 4**: Configure slash commands
From the left sidebar select "Slash Commands". Create `/comedian` slash command with request URL: `http://<ngrok https URL>/commands`) Mark as needed the option of `Escase channels, users and links sent to your app`. 

### **Step 5**: Add Redirect URL in OAuth & Permissions tab
Add a new redirect url `http://<ngrok https URL>/auth`. Save it! This is where Slack will redirect when you install bot into a workspace

### **Step 6**: Run Comedian

CD into your project root directory and run Comedian with `make run` command from your terminal. In case you do not have docker and docker-compose, install them on your machine and try again. 

### **Step 7**: Add Event Subscriptions
In Event Subscriptions tab enable events. Configure URL as follows ```http://<ngrok https URL>/event```. You should receive confirmation of your endpoint. if not, check if your app and ngrok are working and you have internet access. If confirm received, add `app_uninstalled`, `message_groups`, `message_channels`, `team_join` events. 

### **Step 8**: Add Comedian to your workspace
Navigate to `manage distribution` tab and press `Add to Slack` button
